> Harmonizing The Theoretical with Practical


### Ineterests : 
I love Programming languages and its underlying mathematical structures. I like to reason about the behaviours of Programs using theories and tools from Program Analysis, Formal Methods of Verification, Logic, Type systems, etc. Towards these goals, I am currently working on a few interesting ideas in topics related to [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/), ~~Android~~, Plaid, Dependent Types, Typestates, etc.


### Me :
I am currently at the Purdue PL (PuRPL) group, working as a postdoctoral associate in areas related to Program Verification and Functional Programming with [Prof Suresh Jagannathan](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/suresh/). Before this, I have worked for an year on Program Analysis for JS with [Prof Frank Tip](http://www.franktip.org/). Prior to that, I was writing my PhD disseration on _verifying behavioral properties of complex programs_ at [Indian Institute of Science, India](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/) under the guidance of [Prof. Y. N. Srikant](https://drona.csa.iisc.ac.in/~srikant/).

### I am beyond my achievements as well :
#### Books I love
- **Biographies** : I love to read. I find fiction less vivid than the reality of non-fictional characters. My favorite are the Biographies. Here is a list of the few I most recently read/reading-
	- Ali
	- Steve Jobs
	- Ambedkar
	- Gandhi
	- Lincoln
	- Kissinger
