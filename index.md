> Harmonizing the Theoretical with Practical

### About Me :
I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at Purdue University working with  [Prof Suresh Jagannathan](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/suresh/). Before this, I worked for a year on Program Analysis for JS with [Prof Frank Tip](http://www.franktip.org/). I did my PhD dissertation on _verifying behavioral properties of complex programs_ at [Indian Institute of Science, India](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/) under the guidance of [Prof. Y. N. Srikant](https://drona.csa.iisc.ac.in/~srikant/).
  

I am interested in developing techniques and tools to help developers build reliable, secure and efficient Software. In this context, I am especially interested in building program analysis and verification tools, designing programming languages, and developing automated program synthesis techniques for programs with effects, dynamic features and asynchronous semantics.

Recently, I have worked on developing a component-based program synthesis tool (**Cobalt**) to synthesize 
correct programs using effectful libraries. Previously, I have worked on designing a domain-specific language (**Morpheus**) with support for rich refinement types to reason about the correctness of effectful Parser Combinator programs. Before that, I also developed static and dynamic program analysis techniques for Android (**AsyncDroid**) and Javascript programs (**Stubbifier**).

### Beyond Computer Science :
#### Books I love
- **Biographies** : I love to read. I find fiction less vivid than the reality of non-fictional characters. My favorite are the Biographies. Here is a list of the few I most recently read/reading-
	- Ali
	- Steve Jobs
	- Ambedkar
	- Gandhi
	- Lincoln
	- Kissinger
