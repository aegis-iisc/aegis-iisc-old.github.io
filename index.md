## Harmonizing The Theoretical with Practical


### About My Ineterests : 
I love the beauty of the theory of Programming languages, the underlying mathematical structures and results, at the same time I am interested in Program Analysis, Formal Methods of Verification and Reasconing about Program Behaviors. I am interested in simplifying the complexities revolving around problems in these domains in real world softwares. Ergo the harmonization, the love truely is liberating.  



### About Me :
I am currently at the [Northeastern PRL](http://prl.ccs.neu.edu/) group as a Postdoc working with [Prof Frank Tip](http://www.franktip.org/). Before moving to Northeastern, I was writing my disseration on verifying behavioral properties of complex programs at [Indian Institute of Science, India](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/) under the guidance of [Prof. Y. N. Srikant](https://drona.csa.iisc.ac.in/~srikant/).
I am trying to comprehend, reason, analyze, programs written by real-world developers and design programming languages and language features and models to aid them write safe and correct programs. Towards this goal, I am analyzing, reasoning and working of few interesting languages and models like, [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/), Android, Plaid, etc.
