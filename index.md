> Harmonizing the Theoretical with Practical


<!-- ### Ineterests : 
I love Programming languages and its underlying mathematical structures. I like to reason about behaviours of Programs using theories and tools from Program Analysis, Formal Methods of Verification, Logic, Type systems, etc. Towards these goals, I am currently working on a few interesting ideas in topics related to Program Verification, Program Analysis for [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/), ~~Android~~, Plaid, Dependent Types, Typestates, etc. -->


### About Me :
I am a Postdoc at Purdue University working with  [Prof Suresh Jagannathan](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/suresh/). Before this, I have worked for an year on Program Analysis for JS with [Prof Frank Tip](http://www.franktip.org/).I did my PhD disseration on _verifying behavioral properties of complex programs_ at [Indian Institute of Science, India](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/) under the guidance of [Prof. Y. N. Srikant](https://drona.csa.iisc.ac.in/~srikant/).
  

I am interested in developing techniques and tools to help developers build reliable, secure and efficient Software. In this context, I am especially interested in building 
Program Analysis and Verification tools, designing Programming Languages, and developing Automated Program Synthesis techniques for programs with effects, dynamic features and asynchronus semantics.

Recently, I have worked on developing a component-based Program Synthesis technique to synthesize 
correct programs using effectful libraries. Previously, I have worked on desiging a Domain Specific Language with support for rich Refinement Types to reason about correctness of Effectful Parser Combinator Programs. Before that I have also developed static and dynamic program analysis techniques for Android and Javascript programs.

### Beyond Computer Science :
#### Books I love
- **Biographies** : I love to read. I find fiction less vivid than the reality of non-fictional characters. My favorite are the Biographies. Here is a list of the few I most recently read/reading-
	- Ali
	- Steve Jobs
	- Ambedkar
	- Gandhi
	- Lincoln
	- Kissinger
