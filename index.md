> Harmonizing The Theoretical with Practical


### My Ineterests : 
I love Programming languages and its underlying mathematical structures. Concurrently, I like to reason about the behaviours of Programs using theories and tools from Program Analysis, Formal Methods of Verification, Logic, Type systems, etc. I am interested in simplifying the complexities revolving around problems in reasoning about real world softwares and designing programming languages and language features and models to aid them in writing safe and correct programs. Towards these goals, I am currently working on a few interesting ideas in topics related to [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/), ~~Android~~, Plaid, Dependent Types, Typestates, etc.


### Me :
I am currently at the [Northeastern PRL](http://prl.ccs.neu.edu/) group as a Postdoc working with [Prof Frank Tip](http://www.franktip.org/). Before moving to Northeastern, I was writing my PhD disseration on _verifying behavioral properties of complex programs_ at [Indian Institute of Science, India](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/) under the guidance of [Prof. Y. N. Srikant](https://drona.csa.iisc.ac.in/~srikant/). Even before that, I was doing some machine learning at CDAC Mumbai, when every body else was not as interested in ML apparently.

### I am beyond my achievements as well :
#### Books I love
- **Biographies** : I love to read. I find fiction less vivid than the reality of non-fictional characters. My favorite are the Biographies. Here is a list of the few I most recently read/reading-
	- Ali
	- Steve Jobs
	- Ambedkar
	- Gandhi
	- Lincoln
	- Kissinger

- **Others** : My [goodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30126747-ashish-mishra) Profile.
