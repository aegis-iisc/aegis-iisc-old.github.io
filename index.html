## Harmonizing The Theoretical with Practical

### About My Love :
I love the beauty of the theory of Programming languages, the underlying mathematical structures and results, at the same time I get awestruck with the complexities revolving around problems in real world softwares. Ergo the harmonization, the love truely is liberating.  



### About Me :
I am trying to understand, reason about and transform the more practial aspects of programming languages associated with a not so structured (in the sense of design) and extremely powerful language called [https://www.javascript.com/](Javascript) at the [http://prl.ccs.neu.edu/] (Northeastern PRL) group as a Postdoc working with [http://www.franktip.org/] Prof Frank Tip. 
Before moving to "The States" I was writing my disseration on verifying behavioral properties of complex programs.
